# Automatic Accounting System

## Description

There is a very big problem in Poland with taxes. I would like to use this application to automate all activities related to issuing invoices, pits and other things related to basic accounting matters.

## Technologies

Technologies used in this application will be constantly updated

* Front-End side of application
  * [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
  * [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
  * [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
  * [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

## Money

Unfortunately, every project is about money, at the moment I'm working and I'm doing this project as my side project, so I will try to keep the project open source and totally free to use. Unfortunately, tests and servers cost money, so I am thinking about some sponsorship packages, but we will think about it later, at this point, the finished product will be 100% non-profit

## Features

At the moment, I am creating a plan for how I want to run this application, so probably during the development, a beautiful table, a drawing or a dancing unicorn will appear here, which will say what is cool about this project. At the moment, unfortunately, this is a blank [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) application

## Future plans

Unfortunately, in Poland, the tax law, methods of tax settlement and forms of taxation are very complicated, but we'll be fine in the first alpha version of the application, I assume

* automatic issuing of invoices,
* lump sum service,
* automatic analysis of scanned documents

it seems to me that this is a lot for the size and complexity of Polish tax law
